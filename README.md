## Hi!

Welcome to my Looker Studio Portfolio, where I showcase my abilities for data querying and visualization, analytics, and business intelligence. Holding large amounts of data can be powerful but it's useless without insightful visualizations to help uncover patterns, explain behaviours, and make decisions. The right dashboard depends on the business needs and questions, so this is just a sample for an imagined audience.

## Project 1: Chicago Taxi Trips

The city of Chicago (USA) maintains an excellent [open data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) which includes a dataset on [taxi trips spanning from 2013 to 2023](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips-2013-2023-/wrvz-psew/about_data). I've taken a reduced sample corresponding to January of 2023 to create a Looker Studio dashboard that shows a WoW overview of KPIs and other important metrics, a temporal demand and cost analysis, and a geo heatmap for pickup zones. There's also a written report that accompanies the chart.


#### Key findings: 

##### Week over week summary

During the week of January 16–22, the total number of trips experienced a slight decline of 0.9% compared to the previous week. Still, total revenue increased by 2.6%, driven by higher average trip costs and average fares. A deeper look shows that trip duration increased by approximately 4%, which likely contributed to the revenue growth.


##### Temporal demand and cost segmentation

A breakdown by day type shows that 79% of trips occur on weekdays, as expected given the greater number of weekday observations. Weekends, however, still account for 20% of total trips. Notably, weekend trips tend to be more expensive, both in terms of total trip cost and average fare, and they also cover longer distances than weekday trips. 

Across the different times of day, average trip cost rises steadily into the night, consistent with higher nighttime fares. Trip distances peak in the afternoon and evening, likely reflecting rush-hour travel patterns. As anticipated, trip volume drops sharply at night, mirroring typical work and sleep population schedules.


##### Geographical distribution

Key hotspots for taxi pickups include the Walton St. & N. La Salle Dr. intersection in the Rush & Division area and Chicago O’Hare International Airport in Rosemont, both of which serve as major demand hubs.
