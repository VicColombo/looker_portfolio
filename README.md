## Hi!

Welcome to my Looker Studio Portfolio, where I showcase my abilities for data querying and visualization, analytics, and business intelligence. Holding large amounts of data can be powerful but it's useless without insightful visualizations to help uncover patterns, explain behaviours, and make decisions. The right dashboard depends on the business needs and questions, so this is just a sample for an imagined audience.

## Project 1: Chicago Taxi Trips

The city of Chicago (USA) maintains an excellent [open data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) which includes a dataset on [taxi trips spanning from 2013 to 2023](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips-2013-2023-/wrvz-psew/about_data). I've taken a reduced sample corresponding to January of 2023 to create a Looker Studio dashboard that shows a WoW overview of KPIs and other important metrics, a temporal demand and cost analysis, and a geographical demand analysis.
